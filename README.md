🛠️ By day, I'm juggling code in Python, Rust, and C++ From crafting cloud-based bots to taming wild ESP32s, my keyboard adventures span Web, AI, and IoT—basically, if it's got bytes, I've probably tinkered with it.

🚗 Currently making cars smarter at Visteon – 25% less lag, 96% fewer bugs, and 100% fewer dashboards flying out the window (so far!).

✨ Motto: "If at first you don't succeed, sudo it."

🚀 Always excited about projects at the intersection of AI and embedded systems—because who doesn't love teaching silicon brains new tricks?

🔗 Check out my projects to witness the organized chaos!

Always Happy to connect with new nerds 

Happy coding! 🍕💻😄
